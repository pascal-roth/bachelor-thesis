\section{Implementation of Homogeneous reactor}
In this project the constant-volume and fixed-mass reactor will be used. This is due to the fact that in the moment of combustion the volume can be seen as nearly constant while the pressure arises. In the next step the piston would be moved due to the pressure increase so that in this case work is done and the constant-pressure and fixed-mass model would be used.

\item{the third objective function concerns the pressure and says that it has to match at the end of the cool flame with the pressure of the detailed reaction mechanism (end of combustion nearly no difference, end of cool flame around 15\%)}

\begin{equation}
f_{p_{LT}} = \frac{1}{N_{LT}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{LT}} \frac{|p_{1i}^{det}-p_{1i}^{sim}|}{|p_{1i}^{det}|}
\end{equation}

\item{do not necessary yield to realistic species profiles, because intermediate and high temperatures schemes in global reaction mechanism are directly coupled over temperature $\rightarrow$ forth objective function to ensure a correct profile of a stable intermediate species, in case of \cite{vandersickel2013} $I_2$ of the seventh equation of the presented global reaction mechanism}

\begin{equation}
f_{max_{R7}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |t_{max_{R7i}}^{sim}-\tau_{2i}^{sim}|
\end{equation}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item{here $t_{max_{R7i}}^{sim}$ is the time when the maximum of the reaction rate of the intermediate species}

\subsection{Two-staged auto-ignition} %%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item{auto ignition behavior partly depends on the octane number, with a low-octane number the two-staged behavior is clearly visible while with higher octane number as in most gasoline fuels the ignition should not be active under low temperature conditions, resulting in a single-stage behavior (\cite{Chung2015})}
\item{first ignition stage $\rightarrow$ low temperature\\
Internal isomerization is initialized by the abstraction of H-atoms and leads to formation of radicals which are exchanged internally. The number of radicals increases which includes an acceleration of the reaction rates and initializes an exothermic cycle $\rightarrow$ cool flame heat release. }
\item{Negative Temperature coefficient\\
With the rise of the temperature the reactions changes for example explained in \cite{vandersickel2013} where the oxygen addition to the alkyl radical becomes important. This change is equivalent to a termination step because the new radicals recombine to stable intermediates like $H_2O$ or $O_2$. Which reduces the overall reaction rate and hence causes NTC area}
\item{second ignition stage $\rightarrow$ high temperature\\
During NTC the temperature only rises slowly until reaction of $H_2O_2$ becomes important (>1000K), terminating the NTC regime and initiating a branched thermal explosion. Heat release is dominated by oxidation of the intermediates $CH_2O$ to $CO$ and successive oxidation of $CO$ to $CO_2$. } 
\item{ignition times are defined with the heat release curve: first stage ignition time = time till first local maximum, main ignition delay time = global heat release rate maximum}\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Heat Release} %%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{heat_release}
\begin{itemize}
\item{assumption of an adiabatic reactor $\rightarrow$ no heat loss}
\item{but heat release inside the reactor $\rightarrow$ rise in temperature and pressure}
\item{cool flame heat release can count up to 15-20\% of heat release}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item{responsible for cool heat release reaction of $OH$-radicals with fuel and $O_2$ to $H_2O$ and $CO$}
	\end{itemize}
	
\item{heat release during the main ignition:}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item{first stage of main ignition: temperature enough to split up $H_2O_2$ to $2OH$ which results in an increase of the cool flame reaction}
	\item{as temperature rises high temperature scheme takes over}
	\item{mainly heat release through two reactions: $F+O_2 \rightarrow H_2O + CO$ and $CO + O_2 \leftrightarrow CO_2$ where the second reaction is dominant}
	\end{itemize}
	
\item{The first local maximum corresponds to the first stage ignition and the global maximum to the main ignition delay} \\
	
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Calculation steps of the cantera solver} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
\begin{itemize}
\item{mechanism only contains the reactions and their parameters}
\item{\textbf{specific enthalpies} of all species depending on the temperature can be calculated with 
	
	\begin{equation}
	h_k = \Delta_{f,k}^{ref} + \int_{T_{ref}}^T c_{pk}dT
	\end{equation}
	
where $h_k$ as the specific enthalpy of each species  and $c_{pk}$ as the species specific heat capacity depending the current and reference temperature}
	
\item{\textbf{reaction enthalpy} can be calculated using the specific enthalpies of the reaction (possible that for the exact temperature linear interpolation has to be used, since not every value is listened in the table)
	
	\begin{equation}
	\Delta_{R,h} = \Delta \bar{h}_{products} - \Delta \bar{h}_{educts} 
	\end{equation}}
	
\item{\textbf{concentration} at the time $t$ of each species has to be calculated next by using: 
	
	\begin{equation}
	C_{k,t} = Y_{k,t} * \frac{\rho_t}{\bar{M}_{k,t}}
	\end{equation}
	
By making the assumption of an ideal gas $\rho$ can be replaced in the following way
	
	\begin{equation}
	C_{k,t} = Y_{k,t} * \frac{p_t*\frac{T_t}{\bar{R}*\bar{M}_{mean,t}}}{\bar{M}_{k,t}}
	\end{equation}}
	
\item{the \textbf{rate constant} can be calculated with the Arrhenius Equation, therefore the pre-exponential factor $A$, the activation temperature $T_a$ of the reaction and the fitting rate constant $b$ has to be taken out of the chemistry tables:
	
	\begin{equation}
	k_{k,t} = A*T_t^b* exp(-\frac{T_a}{T_t})
	\end{equation}}
	
\item{using the rate constant, the concentrations and the order of the reactions, the \textbf{reaction speed} can be calculated
	
	\begin{equation}
	r_{k,t} = k_{k,t}* \prod C_{x,t}^n 
	\end{equation}}
	
\item{after having the reaction speed the mole factions of the time $t+1$ can be computed (using explicit Euler)}
\item{sum of all reaction enthalpies multiplied with the mole fractions results in the heat release at a certain time}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item{The first local maximum corresponds to the first stage ignition and the global maximum to the main ignition} \\
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
	

\subsection{Tabulated Chemistry Model} %%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item{if mechanism are too large to be directly applied in simulations, tabulated chemistry can be used to include those detailed chemical effects with an affordable computational cost}
\item{method: create chemical look up tables, so that in simulations equations don't have to be solved but instead solution can be looked up in table}
\item{homogeneous reactor creates premixed flamelet tables, where for each starting conditions the solutions are independent}
\item{Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) is the main technique to create tables:}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item{all thermo chemical properties are stored in a look-up table and characterized by the mixture fraction $z$ and reaction progress variable (RPV) \cite{Bekdemir2013}}
	\item{solving  continuity,  species  conservation  and  energy  conservation  equations with table values}
	\item{reaction  progress  variable  (RPV)  varying  from  0  to  1  and used to identify the equilibrium state (RPV=1 when full equilibrium is reached). The varible is defined by a combination of carbon-dioxide ($CO_2$), carbon-monoxide ($CO$) and hydroperoxyl ($HO_2$) because hydroperoxyl first produced by ignition process and soon $CO$ and $CO_2$ follow}
	
	\begin{equation}
	RPV = \sum_i \frac{Y_i}{M_i}
	\end{equation}
	
	\item{mixture fraction varibale is defined with the elements carbon (C), hyrogen (H) and oxygen(O) and their element mass fractions $Z_i$ and molar masses $M_i$, where 1 and 2 is for fuel and oxygen stream (not applicable for homogeneous reactor)}
	
	\begin{equation}
	Z = \frac{2\frac{Z_C-Z_{C,2}}{M_C}+0.5\frac{Z_H-Z_{H,2}}{M_H}-\frac{Z_O-Z_{O,2}}{M_O}}{2\frac{Z_{C,1}-Z_{C,2}}{M_C}+0.5\frac{Z_{H,1}-Z_{H,2}}{M_H}-\frac{Z_{O,1}-Z_{O,2}}{M_O}}
	\end{equation}
	
	\end{itemize}
