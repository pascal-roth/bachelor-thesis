|-----------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------
| abs_rel_deviation_schematic.py    | Pascal Roth | plot the different strictness between absolute and relative tolerance margins 
| contour.py                        | Pascal Roth | show output of HR, MLP and the relative and absolute deviations between both 
| contour.sh                        | Pascal Roth | call contour.py and select initial equivalence_ratio and pressure                    
| contour_iter.sh                   | Pascal Roth | call contour.py for all networks                        
| fc_model.py                       | Pascal Roth | function to build and train the model
| fc_post_processing.py             | Pascal Roth | function for the post processing (load checkpoint, calculate accuracy, compare evolution)
| fc_pre_processing_load.py         | Pascal Roth | function to load and pre-process the samples generated by the HR (normalize, create dataloader)
| MLP_iter.sh                       | Pascal Roth | call MLP.py to create the models for the output quantities used in the thesis
| MLP_iter_comp.sh                  | Pascal Roth | call MLP.py to create the models for the comparison with the GRM by Haspel
| MLP.py                            | Pascal Roth | script to govern the sample loading, pre-processing, model creation and training as well as saving into checkpoint
| MLP.sh                            | Pascal Roth | call MLP.py and define input and output quantities as well as hyperparameters
| post_processing.sh                | Pascal Roth | call post_processing.py and define the plot as well as the necessary parameters
| post-processing.py                | Pascal Roth | generate different plot (comparison of ID, output quantities or calculate accuracies)
